oj2534-fw
Firmware for oj2534

oj2534 is a GPL open-source, SAE J2534 (mostly) compliant tool.
To my knowledge, no similar projects exist.

oj2534 is composed of:
	-hw : STM32F072 evaluation board with electrical interfaces required by J2534
	-fw : firmware for above
	-sw : driver running on host PC, providing the J2534 API (through a standard J2534 dll on windows, other mechanisms possible)

Current status : incomplete
